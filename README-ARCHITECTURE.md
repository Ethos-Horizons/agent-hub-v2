# Agent Hub Architecture - Hybrid AI-Powered Agent Creation

## 🎯 Overview

Agent Hub implements a **hybrid architecture** that combines the best approaches from multiple AI frameworks and architectural patterns. This document outlines how we've synthesized insights from GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok4 to create a robust, scalable, and secure agent creation platform.

## 🏗️ Architectural Principles

### **1. Safety First (GPT-5's Tool-First Approach)**
- **No arbitrary code execution** - All agent behavior runs through approved tools
- **Function calling with validation** - JSON Schema validation for all inputs/outputs
- **Policy-based access control** - Tool allowlists, domain restrictions, tenant scoping
- **Audit trail** - Complete logging of all tool calls and decisions

### **2. Scalable Microservices (Gemini's Containerization)**
- **Agent isolation** - Each agent runs in its own containerized environment
- **Independent scaling** - Scale agents based on demand
- **Sandboxed development** - AI-generated code runs in isolated containers
- **Git-based workflow** - Code changes go through PR review process

### **3. Flexible Workflows (Grok4's Graph-Based Execution)**
- **Workflow definitions** - Declarative workflow graphs stored as JSON/YAML
- **Dynamic routing** - Conditional logic and parallel execution
- **State management** - Persistent workflow state with checkpointing
- **AI generation** - Workflows can be created from natural language

## 🔧 Core Components

### **Tool SDK (`/features/tools`)**
```
Tool Registry → Tool Validation → Policy Guard → Execution Context
```

**Key Features:**
- **Built-in tools** for common operations (Calendar, Forms, Web APIs)
- **JSON Schema validation** for all inputs/outputs
- **Policy enforcement** (domain allowlists, rate limiting, tenant scoping)
- **Execution context** with secrets, logging, and caching

**Example Tool:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'calendar.createEvent',
  description: 'Create a calendar event in Google Calendar',
  inputSchema: { /* JSON Schema */ },
  outputSchema: { /* JSON Schema */ },
  handler: async (ctx, input) => { /* Implementation */ },
  policy: {
    allowedDomains: ['googleapis.com'],
    rateLimit: { requests: 100, window: 3600 }
  }
}
```

### **Workflow Engine (`/features/workflows`)**
```
Workflow Definition → Graph Parser → Node Executor → State Manager
```

**Key Features:**
- **Graph-based execution** with nodes and edges
- **Conditional routing** based on agent decisions
- **State persistence** in Supabase with event journaling
- **Parallel execution** for independent nodes

**Example Workflow:**
```typescript
{
  nodes: [
    { id: 'conversational', agentId: 'chat_agent', type: 'agent' },
    { id: 'research', agentId: 'research_agent', type: 'agent' },
    { id: 'scheduler', agentId: 'scheduler_agent', type: 'agent' }
  ],
  edges: [
    { source: 'conversational', target: 'research' },
    { source: 'research', target: 'scheduler' }
  ]
}
```

### **AI Creation Service (`/features/ai-creation`)**
```
Natural Language → Research → Planning → Coding → Testing → Deployment
```

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-phase AI orchestration** (Research, Planning, Coding, Testing)
- **Sandboxed development** in isolated containers
- **Git integration** with automated PR creation
- **Human approval** for all deployments

**Creation Phases:**
1. **Research**: AI analyzes requirements and finds best practices
2. **Planning**: AI designs architecture and implementation strategy
3. **Coding**: AI generates code in isolated sandbox
4. **Testing**: AI validates functionality and security
5. **Deployment**: Human review and approval required

### **Playground Environment (`/features/playground`)**
```
Isolated Testing → Mock APIs → Real-time Monitoring → Comparison Analysis
```

**Key Features:**
- **Ephemeral environments** for safe testing
- **Mock API services** (Google Calendar, Forms, etc.)
- **Real-time execution monitoring** with event streaming
- **A/B testing** and execution comparison

## 🔒 Security Architecture
